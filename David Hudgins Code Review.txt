The code compiles well with no errors and populates the datagrid with all fields and all 50 rows upon startup.
The code has clear comments on what each method is doing. Code is organized well, with button click events being seperated from other methods.
The form is easy to understand what each button does. Controls are grouped together in practical way.
I had a couple of exceptions thrown. The Min and max decimal parcing fails if in wrong format, or blank.
The state drop down won't work on my machine. It actually doesn't crash, but instead gives error message stating unable to reach path where the database file is located.
I believe this is because of the connection string being given a direct reference to your person computer's file system.
The sorting buttons work better on your's than on mine, with more options than I had. I had no issues getting the grid to sort.
I noticed the search feature has to have an exact match to pull up a state by name. I think you could modify the SQL query where clause to look for "contains" instead of having to match.
The restore button creates a new instance of the form, but doesn't close the old one. I think easy fix by adding this.close() to restore button click event.
I did mine with Linq statements referencing a DataContext object, instead of adding SQL queries into the table adapter. The upside to your method is the queries are all in one place.
Overall, I like the way you clearly laid everything out. I think most of the issues stemmed from that connectionString path being local to your computer.
