Maxwell Weaver code review by Aaron Rash

First of all, you set the connection string to a location specific to your pc, meaning anyone who downloads your program will have to change it to the correct location on their pc.
	that being said, when I changed it to the correct spot for me, it worked as intened.

The 'sort computer jobs asc' button has a small error for me. in the query, it can be fixed by putting the column name in [brackets]
	Order By '# of Computer Jobs' Asc
		vs
	Order By [# of Computer Jobs] Asc

this tends to be the case when column names have more than one word, or special characters. I had the same problem on mine

If the min/max textboxs are left blank or have non-decimal values the program crashes.
	just throw that in a try/catch or some other error handling 

The restore button opens a new form, which isnt ideal in my opinion. you can set the datasource back to the original source and it will have the same effect
	stateInfoDataGridView.DataSource = statesDBDataSet.StateInfo;
	
Searching by the column values is quite different than what I did. You filtered the rows, while I used the queries from the table adapter
Neither is right but I thought it was worth mentioning alternate solutions.
Your main search function requires exact matches, and is case sensitive, which is a bit user unfriendly.
I reccomend using ".contains" or ".StartsWith" instead of "==" in your filter.

	filteredRows = filteredRows.Where(row => row.Field<string>("StateName") == name;
		vs
	filteredRows = filteredRows.Where(row => row.Field<string>("StateName").StartsWith(name));
	
		then add .ToLower for case insensitive
		
	filteredRows = filteredRows.Where(row => row.Field<string>("StateName").ToLower().StartsWith(name));

Your code is well organized and readable, and you have good comments.

That might seem like a lot, but I went deep because I thought it was really interesting to see how different our approach was. I learned some new things off of you.
